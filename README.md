- **RAL Colors**: The globally recognized RAL color palette, especially used in architecture and industrial design.
- **RAL DESIGN SYSTEM plus**: An extended color system with over 1,800 defined colors for precise color design in architecture and design.

## Supported Targets
The tool is compatible with various target platforms for color processing and representation in applications:

- **Avalonia**: A cross-platform GUI framework specifically designed for .NET.
- **Monogame / XNA-based Frameworks**: Especially useful for 2D and 3D game development with Monogame and XNA.
- **Skia**: A graphic framework developed by Google, used in many mobile and web applications.
- **System.Drawing**: A standard .NET library for basic 2D graphics and bitmap processing.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: A framework for developing desktop applications on Windows, commonly used for graphical user interfaces and 2D graphics.

Further targets are planned for additional platform support.

## Features
The tool offers a variety of powerful functions for performing color operations:

- **28 Transformers**: Different functions for color manipulation, including adjustment, correction, and effect treatments.
- **19 Blenders**: Allows blending colors in various ways to create new colors (e.g., linear blending, additive or subtractive).
- **22 Spaces**: Supports a large number of color models and spaces to allow versatile and flexible color handling.
- **Extensions for Colors**: Extensions for advanced color applications that go beyond the standard functions.

## Supported Color Spaces/Models
The tool supports a wide range of color models and spaces, including:
